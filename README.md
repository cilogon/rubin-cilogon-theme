# cilogon-theme

This is the Rubin Observatory's CSS theme for the CILogon login page for Rubin Science Platform authentication. The key file in this repository is [src/rubin.css](./src/rubin.css), which we hand over to CILogon to embed in the pages they serve. Other files in `src` are designed for enabling a development preview by including HTML, CSS, image, and JS assets usually provided by CILogon.

To preview the theme, on [src/index.html](./src/index.html) in a browser.
